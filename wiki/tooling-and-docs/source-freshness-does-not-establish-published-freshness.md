# Source freshness does not establish published freshness

Verified: after the concurrency simplification, source declarations and generated Markdown were current while the checked-in website still exposed retired bounds and a removed module route. The user found this in the API reference. A source-generation check alone cannot verify the HTML, downloadable schemas, or search index that readers receive.

Apply when: removing or renaming public language/API surface, or reporting a documentation update complete.
Evidence: the user's follow-up to [the concurrency change](https://github.com/manuscript-lang/manuscript/pull/24); [publication checks](../../tests/docs/publication.test.cjs); [publishing workflow](../../.github/workflows/cicd.yml).
Verify: regenerate both reference sources and the website with destination cleanup; compare shipped schema downloads against current generated sources, reject obsolete module routes, and search rendered pages and search data for retired terminology. Confirm publication separately from a successful source merge.
