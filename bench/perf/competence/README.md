# Competence kernels

Ordinary programs grouped by what a general-purpose language must do well, each compared with idiomatic Go and checked for an identical checksum. Optimize for these competences, not for one program.

| Kernel | Competence |
| --- | --- |
| `call_fib_36` | recursive calls |
| `dispatch_100M` | interface method dispatch |
| `closure_100M` | calling a captured closure |
| `sort_1M` | sorting with a comparator |
| `text_1M` | string building, splitting, integer parsing |
| `strmap_10M` | string-keyed map updates |
| `errors_50M` | `Result` propagation with `try` |
| `records_1M_x20` | iterating a list of records |

Run `MS=./ms sh bench/perf/competence/run.sh 5` (min of N, microseconds). Compare only runs from the same machine.
