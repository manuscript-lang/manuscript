# Welcome to the Manuscript Feature Emporium!

Step right up and behold the wondrous constructs and capabilities that make Manuscript tick, tock, and occasionally, whizz-bang! This section is your grand tour through the nuts and bolts (and a few shiny bells and whistles) of the language, all neatly categorized for your perusing pleasure.

## The Crown Jewels: Core Language Constructs

These are the essential tools in your Manuscript utility belt, the bread and butter of your coding concoctions.

### [Variables](variables/)
Master the art of naming things, assigning them types (or letting Manuscript guess!), and generally bossing data around.

### [Functions](functions/)
Learn to bottle your brilliance into reusable blocks of code. Parameters, return types, and the mysterious closures await!

### [Control Flow](control-flow/)
Become the puppet master of your program's execution. Conditional statements, elegant loops, and the ever-so-clever pattern matching.

### [Data Structures](data-structures/)
Organize your digital life with arrays, objects, maps, and even your own custom-brewed types. No more data chaos!

### [Piped Syntax](piped-syntax/)
For when your data needs a luxurious journey through a series of functions. It's like a spa day for your information!

### [Error Handling](error-handling/)
Because sometimes things go sideways. Learn about Manuscript's approach to gracefully (or not so gracefully) dealing with mishaps using error types and result types.

### [Modules](modules/)
Keep your code tidy and shareable with Manuscript's module system. Imports and exports have never been so exciting (okay, maybe they have, but these are good too).

### [Types and Interfaces](types-interfaces/)
Define the shape of your data and the contracts for your code with custom types and interfaces. It's like drawing blueprints for your digital creations.

## The Philosophy Stone: Language Design

Ever wonder *why* Manuscript is the way it is? These core principles are the secret sauce (now, not so secret).

- **Clarity** - Code should be as easy to read as your favorite comic book, and (mostly) as understandable.
- **Safety** - The type system is your ever-vigilant guardian angel, helping to prevent those pesky common errors.
- **Productivity** - Less typing, more doing. Manuscript aims for minimal boilerplate and syntax that just *feels* right.
- **Performance** - Under the hood, it's zippy! Manuscript compiles to efficient Go code, so your programs can fly.

> Clear code takes form,
> Safe, swift, a joy to compose,
> Ideas ignite.

## The Alchemist's Quick Reference

A handy cheat-sheet for when you need a feature faster than you can say "abracadabra."

### Basic Syntax Spells
```ms
// Variables: Giving names to your digital pets
let name = "value"
let count int = 42 // Sometimes, you gotta be explicit

// Functions: Bundling your magic
fn functionName(param type) returnType {
  return value // And out comes the rabbit!
}

// Control Flow: Making choices and repeating yourself (efficiently)
if condition {
  // Do this thing
} else {
  // Or perhaps this thing
}

for item in collection {
  // Do this for every item, like a diligent gnome
}

// Piped Syntax: Data's day out
data | transform | validate | save

// Types: Defining the essence of your data
type CustomType {
  field string
  count int
}
```

## What's Ready in the Workshop: Feature Status

Here's a list of features that are polished, documented, and ready for your coding adventures:

- ✅ Variables and basic types (The ABCs)
- ✅ Functions and parameters (The verbs and nouns)
- ✅ Control flow (if/else, loops) (The Choose Your Own Adventure bits)
- ✅ Basic data structures (Your digital storage solutions)
- ✅ Piped syntax for function chaining (The elegant data conveyor belt)
- ✅ Error handling with bang functions (For when things go "bang!")
- ✅ Pattern matching (The "aha!" moment of data inspection)
- ✅ Module imports (Sharing is caring, for code too)
- ✅ Custom types and interfaces (Designing your own data species)
