Greetings, intrepid coder! So, you've decided to delve into the wondrous world of the Manuscript programming language? Excellent choice! This guide is your trusty map to getting up and running, casting your first simple spell, and figuring out which amazing path to explore next. Adventure awaits!

> New language gleams,
> Blank page whispers, "Start coding!"
> Worlds wait to be built.

## Gearing Up: Installation
First things first, every great adventurer needs their gear. In this case, it's getting Manuscript installed on your trusty machine.

Follow the [installation guide](/downloads/) to learn how to build Manuscript from source. Don't worry, it's less like forging a legendary sword and more like following a really good recipe.

## Your First Incantation: "Hello, Manuscript!"
Time to make some magic happen! This is the traditional first spell for any aspiring coder â€“ making your program say hello to its new favorite language.

1.  Create a new file. Let's call it `hello.ms` (the `.ms` stands for Manuscript Spell, probably).
2.  Inscribe the following magical words into your `hello.ms` file:

    ```ms
    // This line tells Manuscript to print a message to your screen.
    print("Hello, Manuscript! It's a pleasure to meet you.")
    ```

3.  Now, open your command terminal (your magic scroll reader) and run your spell with:

    ```bash
    msc hello.ms
    ```

If all goes well, you should see "Hello, Manuscript! It's a pleasure to meet you." appear. Congratulations, you've cast your first Manuscript spell! You're officially a Manuscript practitioner.

- **[Take the Grand Tour](/docs/getting-started/tour/)**: Get a bird's-eye view of the entire Manuscript kingdom with our comprehensive language tour. It's like a scenic bus tour, but with more code.
- **[Mastering Variables & Types](/docs/constructs/variables/)**: Learn how to name your data (your "data pets") and understand their different species (types).
- **[The Art of Functions](/docs/constructs/functions/)**: Discover how to bottle your code into reusable magic spells (functions).
- **[Behold the Examples](/docs/examples/)**: See Manuscript in action with a gallery of practical code examples. It's like visiting a museum of fine code.

Pick a path, any path, and continue your adventure. Happy coding!
