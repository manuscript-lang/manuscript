# Manuscript Language Constructs

Learn about the core language constructs and features that make up Manuscript.

## Core Language Features

### Basic Constructs
- [Variables and Types](/docs/constructs/variables/) - Variable declarations, type system, and type inference
- [Functions](/docs/constructs/functions/) - Function definitions, parameters, return types, and closures
- [Control Flow](/docs/constructs/control-flow/) - Conditional statements, loops, and pattern matching
- [Data Structures](/docs/constructs/data-structures/) - Arrays, objects, maps, and custom types

### Advanced Features
- [Modules](/docs/constructs/modules/) - Module system, imports, and exports
- [Error Handling](/docs/constructs/error-handling/) - Error types, handling patterns, and result types
- [Concurrency](/docs/constructs/concurrency/) - Concurrent programming primitives
- [Meta Programming](/docs/constructs/meta-programming/) - Code generation and reflection

## Language Design Principles

Manuscript is designed with the following principles in mind:

- **Clarity**: Code should be easy to read and understand
- **Safety**: Type system helps prevent common errors
- **Productivity**: Minimal boilerplate and intuitive syntax
- **Performance**: Efficient compilation to Go code
